"""
Generate the Meridian Supply Co. dataset — the synthetic company every example in this
book runs against.

Two rules govern this file:

1.  **Deterministic.** Seeded throughout. Two people running it get byte-identical output,
    which is what lets the book quote exact numbers.
2.  **The documents are written from the warehouse, not beside it.** Quarterly reviews
    state figures computed from the generated transactions. If a chapter answers a question
    from a document and another chapter answers it from SQL, the two agree — because there
    is only one source of truth here.

Standard library only. No network. No personal data of any kind.

            The year closes with revenue of {money(a['revenue'])} in the fourth quarter
            and gross margin at {a['margin_pct']}%. Both are ahead of the plan we set in
            January, and both are the product of work done in the regions rather than in
            this office.

            The Sanitation range, launched eighteen months ago, is now a material part of
            what we sell. That is faster than we expected.

            The Columbus depot will close for inventory count from December 27 to 29. Orders
            placed after 23 December will dispatch on 30 December.

            ## Reminder

            All purchase orders above $25,000 now require a second approval. The threshold
            was $50,000 until October.
